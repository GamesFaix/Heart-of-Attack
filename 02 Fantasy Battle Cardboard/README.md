# Fantasy Battle Cardboard

Fantasy Battle Cardboard was a tabletop version of Fantasy Battle Deluxe, created to test game mechanics while we were learning how to use Unity3D. The board was a piece of posterboard with a 3in. x 3in. grid (lost). Game tokens were printed on 3in. x 3in. cardstock. An "assistant" app was created in Unity to keep track of the turn order, and this evolved into the game engine over time.

Based on memory and the dates on archive files, I think this stage was worked on from around August 2011 to November 2011.
