## About this repository

I learned how to program by making this game, in order to make this game. It was not until later that I learned how to use version control. This repository is a reconstruction of that project's progress, based on archived project backups.

## Stages of development

0. Ideation (Early 2011)

    We discussed a lot of game ideas casually, without any intent to make any of them. Those ideas coalesced into Fantasy Battle Deluxe (Heart of Attack's original name). At this point I had no real programming experience, aside from some HTML and MIDI.

1. Fantasy Battle Micro (Mid 2011)

    We decided the full scope of Fantasy Battle Deluxe was too much to take on, so we attempted a game whose sequel could be FBD. I created a rough prototype in YoYo GameMaker. It is interactive, but not really playable. You can see from the menus that the 8 faction themes are there, although barely any units are implemented.

2. Fantasy Battle Cardboard (Late 2011 - Early 2012)

    We quickly found GameMaker to be too limiting, and discovered Unity3D. After doing some initial experiments with the 3D environment, we realized it was going to take a little while to understand the tools enough to build what we wanted.

    So, while learning Unity, we also started playtesting mechanics with a tabletop version. I created a GUI app in Unity to help us keep track of in-game data, starting with the turn order (which is quite a complicated thin in Heart of Attack). This evolved into the game engine over time,

3. Fantasy Battle Deluxe (2012 - 2013)

    Our initial vision was for a strategy game that took place around the surface of a cube. This created a lot of graphical and control challenges. The text in menus was also written in a broken "mistranslated" style that was confusing. This made it into a playable alpha state.

4. Heart of Attack (2013 - 2014)

    We eventually simplified to a flat map, cleaned up the menu text, and changed the name. There was a smooth evolution from stage 3 to 4, not a single change event. This made it into a beta testing state, with enough functionality to complete a game. A lot of emphasis in this phase was on usability improvements to facilitate beta testing with outsiders.
