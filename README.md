# Heart-of-Attack

Heart of Attack is a multi-player, turn-based, strategy computer game that was never released. It was developed from February 2012 to October 2014.

* Several friends also helped playtest and spitball ideas (Bjorn, Lauren)

I learned how to program by making this game, in order to make this game. It was not until later that I learned how to use version control. This repository is a reconstruction of that project's progress, based on archived project backups.
