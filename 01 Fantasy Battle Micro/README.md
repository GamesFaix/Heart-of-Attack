# Fantasy Battle Micro

Fantasy Battle Micro was a scaled back version of the vision for Fantasy Battle Deluxe, implemented using YoYo GameMaker.

I have very few archives of this version. All the files included were dated 2012-02-11.

* `FBM advanced.exe` is a working export
* `fantasty butter microwave3.gmk` is a GameMaker project file
* `FBM Rebuild Documentation.ods` looks like it could be something used by GameMaker, it doesn't ring any bells.
